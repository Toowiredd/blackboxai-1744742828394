# Interactive 3D Dashboard Roadmap

This document outlines all TODOs and tasks required to evolve the current interactive 3D dashboard project into a fully immersive, modular, production-grade, and user-friendly 3D workspace with maintainable code structure.

---

## 0. Project Structure & Refactoring

### 0.1 Modular File Organization
- **Task:** Refactor large files into smaller, manageable components before implementation.
- **Steps:**
  - Split `main.js` into modules: scene setup, controls, button management, animations, UI handlers.
  - Split `app.py` into blueprints or separate modules: API routes, socket events, auth, utils.
  - Organize CSS into partials or scoped stylesheets if needed.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in all refactored files.

### 0.2 File Size Limits
- **Task:** Ensure no file exceeds 3400 lines.
- **Steps:**
  - Monitor file sizes during development.
  - Automatically break up files exceeding limits.
  - Maintain clear module boundaries and interfaces.

## 1. Backend Enhancements

### 1.1 Button Configuration Persistence
- **Task:** Implement validation and persistence for button configuration updates.
- **Steps:**
  - Validate incoming button config data in `/api/button/config` endpoint.
  - Store button states (position, rotation, scale, URL) in a database or file.
  - Implement retrieval endpoint to load saved button configurations on client connect.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `app.py`.

### 1.2 Headless Browser Integration
- **Task:** Integrate real headless browser capture and streaming.
- **Steps:**
  - Implement Puppeteer or Playwright integration in `headless_browser.py`.
  - Modify `/api/browser/capture` to launch headless browser, capture screenshot or stream.
  - Handle errors and timeouts gracefully.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `app.py` and `headless_browser.py`.

### 1.3 Security and Authentication
- **Task:** Add authentication and security measures.
- **Steps:**
  - Implement user authentication (e.g., Flask-Login).
  - Secure API endpoints with authentication checks.
  - Add CORS and security headers.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `app.py`.

## 2. Frontend Enhancements

### 2.1 Spatial Interaction Improvements
- **Task:** Enhance 3D tile interaction with resizing and rotation handles.
- **Steps:**
  - Implement visual handles for resizing and rotation using Three.js helpers.
  - Add event listeners for handle interactions.
  - Update button properties in real-time.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `main.js`.

### 2.2 Real-Time Synchronization
- **Task:** Synchronize button states across clients.
- **Steps:**
  - Emit button config changes via Socket.IO on form submission and drag end.
  - Listen for updates and apply changes to 3D scene.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `main.js` and `socket-client.js`.

### 2.3 Live Content Embedding
- **Task:** Render live or streamed web content inside 3D panels.
- **Steps:**
  - Implement texture updates with live screenshots or video streams.
  - Support interactive content (clicks, scrolls) inside panels.
  - Add loading and error states UI.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `main.js`.

### 2.4 UI/UX Improvements
- **Task:** Improve configuration panel and overall UX.
- **Steps:**
  - Add presets, tooltips, and onboarding tutorials.
  - Implement keyboard and gamepad navigation.
  - Enhance animations and visual feedback.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.

## 3. Testing and Optimization

### 3.1 Testing
- **Task:** Add unit and integration tests.
- **Steps:**
  - Write tests for backend API endpoints.
  - Write tests for frontend logic and UI components.
  - Automate testing with CI/CD pipelines.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in test files.

### 3.2 Performance Optimization
- **Task:** Optimize rendering and resource usage.
- **Steps:**
  - Profile Three.js rendering performance.
  - Implement lazy loading and resource cleanup.
  - Optimize network usage for streaming.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry in `main.js`.

---

## 4. Documentation

- **Task:** Provide comprehensive documentation.
- **Steps:**
  - Document setup, usage, and development instructions.
  - Document API endpoints and event protocols.
  - Maintain changelog and roadmap updates.
  - Add code comments referencing this roadmap entry throughout the codebase.
